As a result we established Katukina.com early 2015, when Rapé was a rare underground commodity, and hardly available online. Now, almost 7 years onwards we proudly continue to offer our abundant variety of Rapé's, ashes and Tabaco powders from their original tribal sources in Acre, Brazil. Additionally, Kuripe and Tepi (Rapé blowpipes) and rare shamanic items such as Kambo, Sananga, Piri Piri, Dragon's Blood, Mapacho, Palo Santo and other shamanic incenses, teas, spices, superfoods, health promoted tonics and visionary  art forms can be found on our website.<\/strong><\/p>",

In their view, every human being is driven by finding a balanced relationship with its distinct surrounding, including men, animals, and spirits.
